# FraudDetection-TargetMarketing
Use Python Scikit Learn to solve both the target marketing and the fraud detection problems. 
(1) Perform hyperparameter tuning of the two classifiers by changing at least three different hyperparameters of each classifier.
(2) Use random and grid search for hyperparameter tuning. Also use cross-validation.
(3) Discuss what hyperparameter ranges are best for each classifier for these two problems.
(4) Compare and evaluate the different classifiers using the testset and find the best classifier for criterion (e.g. accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
